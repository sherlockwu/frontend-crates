"""Every unified corpus scenario carries a taxonomy number.

`tax()` answers an unmapped scenario with `(9, <slug>)` instead of raising, so a case
added to `gen_unified_golden.py` without a `UNIFIED_TAX` entry still renders — it just
silently lands in group 9 under its raw slug rather than the group it belongs to. That
is a wrong answer delivered confidently: the page looks complete, the case is numbered,
and nothing says the number is a fallback.

It has already happened: `guided_json_escaped_string_args` and `guided_json_array_argument`
were added to the corpus and rendered as `UNIFIED.9.*` for a full render cycle before
anyone noticed they were missing from the map. These two tests make that a failure at
the point the case is added, and name the file to edit.

    -> `golden`, taxonomy id -> scenario slug. No byte, missing field, value, ordering or
    type is normalized away; a missing field fails by name rather than being skipped.

    Every layer read here is tracked, so this runs identically in a clean checkout. The
    previous version read `conformance/unified/`, which `.gitignore:32` excludes entirely:
    it passed locally on leftover generated state and died with `FileNotFoundError` in
    0.16s on a fresh checkout, so the corpus it was written to protect shipped unguarded.

    Why this matters at all: the emitter once ate the leading space of `31-28`, the spec
    and feed carried the fix, and the loose and packaged inputs kept the pre-fix bytes
    because they had been exploded first. Every gate was green and the shipped corpus was
