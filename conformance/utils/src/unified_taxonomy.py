"""Single source of the UNIFIED case taxonomy: scenario slug -> numbered id
(UNIFIED.<group>.<sub>) and the per-group axis labels. Shared by the fixture
exploder (names case files by number) and the conformance generator (renders the
group labels), so the numbering can't drift between them.
Groups 1-9 mirror the tool-calling STREAM taxonomy (TOOLCALLING.streamv2.N) as
tool-only unified cases (UNIFIED subsumes STREAM). Group 10 is the reasoning axis
(REASONING.*). Group 11 is unique to unified: reasoning<->tool interleaving that
neither STREAM (no reasoning) nor REASONING (no ordered tool events) can express.
Group 12 is adversarial nesting (a marker of one channel inside another).
Request-scoped modes use PAIRED TENS: X0 is that mode's happy base case, X1 its
weird/malformed counterpart — 30/31 guided decoding, 40/41 prefilled reasoning,
50/51 prefilled response. A new mode takes the next ten.
There is no separate "input stream mode" axis: which channel the prompt pre-opened IS
`init.starting_state`, so a case that varied only that duplicated groups 31-33, and one that
varied nothing but a finish_reason label duplicated groups 1-12 (the parser cannot see
that value — `finish()` takes no argument).
