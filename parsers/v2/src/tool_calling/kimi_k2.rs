//! Streaming tool-call parser for Kimi K2.
//!
//! Kimi K2 emits tool calls as
//!   `<|tool_calls_section_begin|>`
//!     `<|tool_call_begin|>functions.NAME:IDX<|tool_call_argument_begin|>{JSON}<|tool_call_end|>`
//!     ... (one or more calls)
//!   `<|tool_calls_section_end|>`
//! The model may also emit singular section variants
//! (`<|tool_call_section_begin|>` / `<|tool_call_section_end|>`), and may drop
//! `section_end` entirely on max_tokens / EOS truncation.
//!
//! The streaming concern (buffering, chunk-split marker safety, normal_text
//! suppression) is owned by the shared [`scan::WrappedBlockScanner`]; the K2
//! grammar maps onto it with section variants as multi-token block markers,
//! the inner `call_end`/`argument_begin` markers as extra orphan markers, and
//! two K2-specific spec fields: the suppression latch engages after every
//! in-section call parse even when the call is malformed (`InvokeLatch::Always`),
//! and a call whose `call_end` never arrives before the section close is
//! dropped rather than swallowing the fence (`drop_invoke_crossing_block_end`).
//!
//! The per-call typing (function-id parsing, JSON validation, raw-string
//! fallback for malformed args) is delegated to the v1 batch parser
//! `try_tool_call_parse_kimi_k2` driven by the same `KimiK2ParserConfig`
//! `dynamo_parsers` uses for batch parsing, so a streamed call matches exactly
//! what the batch parser produces. A complete call is wrapped in the section
//! markers before delegating so the v1 parser always takes its normal section
//! path.
//!
//! The per-call arguments are already a JSON object string, so no key-order
//! reserialization is needed (unlike the XML families): the v1 parser
//! round-trips compact JSON byte-for-byte and falls back to the raw string for
//! malformed payloads, which is exactly what the fixtures expect.
