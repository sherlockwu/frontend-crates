//! Shared streaming-scan core for the marker-delimited tool-call families.
//!
//! Before this module, every family reimplemented the same streaming concerns
//! by copy-paste-and-edit: the longest-prefix marker holdback existed 7 times,
//! the source-order argument reserialization 5 times, and the buffer-and-scan
//! `drain(flush)` loop 7 times (the MiniMax M2 vs M3 copies were ~90%
//! line-identical). Divergent copies are how chunk-boundary bugs get fixed in
//! one family and stay broken in the others; this module is the single parent.
//!
//! Three layers, adopted per family as far as its grammar allows:
//!
//! * [`marker_prefix_suffix_len`] — partial-marker holdback, used by ALL
//!   scan families (the bespoke ones compose it with extra components).
//! * [`reorder_arguments`] — source-order argument reserialization for the
//!   families that delegate typing to a v1core batch parser (which builds
//!   arguments from a `HashMap` with nondeterministic key order).
//! * [`WrappedBlockScanner`] — the whole drain loop for the four families
//!   whose grammar is `BLOCK_START (INVOKE .. INVOKE_END)* BLOCK_END` with a
//!   bare-invoke back-off: qwen3_coder, minimax_m2, minimax_m3, kimi_k2.
//!   dsml (incremental invoke-header state), glm47 (identifier-anchored bare
//!   recovery), and gemma4 (brace/string-aware end scanning) keep bespoke
//!   drains and share the primitives.
//!
//! Behavior differences between the wrapped families are explicit
//! [`WrappedBlockSpec`] fields, not silent copy drift — e.g. MiniMax M2
//! clears the normal-text suppression latch after a bare-invoke recovery
//! while M3/qwen3/kimi keep it latched ([`BareRecoveryLatch`]).
//!
//! # Ordered output
//!
//! The drain loop emits [`UnifiedParserEvent`]s — text, reasoning and calls in the
//! order the model produced them. Tool-only parsers project that down to
//! [`ToolParseResult`] via `push`/`finish` and see no behavior change (that
//! projection is lossy about order, which is all the tool-only contract ever
//! promised). Unified parsers take the ordered list through `push_ordered` /
//! `finish_ordered`. One scan, two views — so reasoning-aware and
//! reasoning-unaware families cannot drift on marker handling, chunk-boundary
//! holdback, or recovery.
//!
//! Reasoning is opt-in per scanner via [`WrappedBlockScanner::with_reasoning`].
//! It is scoped OUTSIDE tool blocks only: once a block or bare invoke is open,
//! a reasoning marker inside it is argument data, not a control token (`I7`).

/// The candidates are the span's own OPENER (a second one is a duplicate, not

/// NATIVE PATH ONLY. An earlier revision of this comment claimed the guided drain
/// shared it; that stopped being true when the guided path moved to its own
/// vocabulary, and the two sets are not the same:
///
/// * native here — the span's opener plus `orphan_markers` (`</tool_call>`),
///   because tool OPENERS are structural on this path and are handled separately
///   as `InReasoning::ToolOpen`;
/// * guided — `holdback_markers` plus the opener, because guided decoding delivers
///   the call as JSON, so tool markup inside a thought is narration to strip, not
///   structure to enter.
///
/// The divergence is deliberate, but it is a divergence, so the parity it used to
/// guarantee by construction is now only guaranteed by
/// `guided_and_native_agree_on_the_same_reasoning_bytes` in `unified/qwen3.rs`.
