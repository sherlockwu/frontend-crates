//! Streaming tool-call parser for Gemma 4.
//!
//! Gemma 4 emits tool calls with a custom non-JSON, non-XML grammar:
//!   `<|tool_call>call:NAME{key:<|"|>value<|"|>, key2:42, key3:[...]}<tool_call|>`
//! with bare unquoted keys, `<|"|>`-delimited strings, nested objects/arrays, and
//! MULTIPLE calls concatenated with NO separator. START = `<|tool_call>`,
//! END = `<tool_call|>` (asymmetric).
//!
//! The streaming concern (buffering, chunk-split marker safety, normal_text
//! suppression, EOF-truncation drop) is owned here. Per-block name + value typing
//! is delegated to the v1 batch parser `try_tool_call_parse_gemma4`, so a streamed
//! call matches exactly what the batch parser produces. A call is emitted only
//! once its complete `<|tool_call> ... <tool_call|>` block has streamed; an
//! incomplete trailing block at EOF is DROPPED (v1 parity), not emitted with empty
//! arguments.
//!
//! Block-completion detection (where the `<tool_call|>` end marker actually closes
//! a call, ignoring a bare `<tool_call|>` literal embedded inside a `<|"|>` string
//! value) reuses the v1 helper `find_tool_call_end_position_gemma4` rather than
//! re-implementing the balanced-brace + string-delimiter scan, so the streaming
//! and batch paths share one block boundary definition.
//!
//! Arguments are re-serialized in source key order because the v1 parser builds
//! them from a `serde_json::Map` (a `BTreeMap` without the `preserve_order`
//! feature), which sorts keys alphabetically; the fixtures store arguments as an
//! exact JSON string in the model-emitted order (the order vLLM's Rust parser also
//! preserves), so order has to be pinned to source order.
